# swift-bot is not like everyone else :)

With the help of **SwiftBot, about a dozen personal digital asset management systems have already been built and are successfully functioning**.
Each of them is unique, has its own purpose and specialization.
You can build **an automatic currency exchanger**, a crypto wallet distributed between exchanges, **a trading system with your own algorithms**, or simply integrate the most accurate information about rates into your business processes.

Manage the accounts of your cryptocurrency exchanges through a single unified interface that is completely under your control.

* Creation of a trading bot for your needs in the shortest possible time thanks to the microservices pattern.
* Lightning fast execution of requests to exchanges! Calculation of thousands of order combinations and their successful placement in hundredths of a second.
* Asynchronous multithreaded architecture allows you to work with multiple exchanges simultaneously

## Safety

- Each module of the system has only those rights that are indicated to it
- Each time the system is started, all internal passwords of the modules are changed to new ones
- You can independently change the access rights settings for each module
- You can disable withdrawal methods for any of the exchanges
